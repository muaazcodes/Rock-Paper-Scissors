# 🪨✋✌️ Rock Paper Scissors Game

Welcome to a simple and fun **Rock Paper Scissors** game written in Python! 🐍

This is a basic console game where you play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer. The program randomly selects the computer's move and compares it with your choice to determine the winner.

---

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Run the Python script.
2. Enter a number based on your move:

   * `0` for Rock ✊
   * `1` for Paper ✋
   * `2` for Scissors ✌️
3. The computer will randomly choose its move.
4. The result will be displayed on the screen — win, lose, or draw!

## 💡 Example Output

```
Enter your choice Type 0 for rock 1,for 2 for paper 3 for scissors
0
Computer Chose:
✋
You lose
```

---

## 🛠 Requirements

* Python 3.x
* No external libraries needed (uses Python’s built-in `random` module)

---

## 🧠 Notes

* If you enter an invalid number (anything other than 0, 1, or 2), you’ll automatically lose the game.
* The logic currently has some inconsistencies in win/lose messages — feel free to improve it as a mini challenge!

---

## 🚀 Running the Game

Simply open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
python Rock\ Paper\ Scissors.py
```

---

## 📌 Future Improvements (Optional Ideas)

* Add more detailed messages (e.g., "Rock crushes Scissors!")
* Let the user play multiple rounds
* Keep track of scores
* Improve input validation

Have fun playing! 🎉
